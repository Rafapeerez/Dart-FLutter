First of all, you must have installed Flutter, Android Studio and VSCode.

It is possible use you physical device to test the app, you have to activate the developper function in yout phone and yhe USB debugging. Doing this and being connected phyiscally to the computer, your device should appear.
Furthemore, you should installed some extensions in VSCode like Flutter and Dart.

You clone this repository:
### `git clone`

Using the VSCode palette (CTRL+SHIFT+P) you search:
### `Flutter: Select Device`
You decide the device to launch the app.

To test the app do the next command and and wait for it to finish loading and the app to appear in the device:
### `F5`
